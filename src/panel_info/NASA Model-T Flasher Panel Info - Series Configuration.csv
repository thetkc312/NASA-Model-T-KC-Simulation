"All units are in cm unless otherwise indicated.

A ""Recieving Panel Max Arm Length"" value of 0 means that no protruding arm is possible due to stowed geometry of the flasher.

The ""Stowed Arm Protrusion Angle (Degrees)"" Measures the angle relative to the vertical at which the arm would protrude from the edge of the panel to which it were mounted.",,,,,,,,,,,,
