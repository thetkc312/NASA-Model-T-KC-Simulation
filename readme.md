A program designed to evaluate kinematic coupling error propagation throughout the flasher, and potentially to estimate the severity of overconstraint.

The foundation of this program is based on tolerance specification values for points of contact in the kinematic couplings that align panels. A class instance is created where 6 points of contact are specified as positions with unit normal vectors (representing ball-on-plane or similar interfaces). Subclasses may exist for specific KC configurations, such that slightly differing instances can be created without needing to specify as many parameters. A function takes as input 6 parameters, being alignment errors for each of the points of contact along their unit normal vectors (representing manufacturing errors at each point of contact in the KC). The function returns a vector indicating the change in position as a result of the misalignments and a rotation matrix for the panel's new position.
